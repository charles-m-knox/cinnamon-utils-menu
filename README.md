NOTE: This applet is essentially deprecated because of the new menus in cinnamon 1.4. It was a good run, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for your support
 

*Cinnamon Utilities Menu* - a simple clickable item that brings up a few powerful utilities that one might use on a regular basis.

You can do the following:

- Take a screenshot of any portion of the screen (click and drag)

- Launch the GNOME Terminal

- Start GNOME Looking Glass

- Launch the Cinnamon Settings window

- Reload the current theme

- Restart Cinnamon

This was inspired by kolle's restart cinnamon extension: [Link](http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/14); based on a user's request to have a confirmation instead of it being a one-click function. I interpreted this as "more than one-click" to restart Cinnamon, and that's what this accomplishes (along with the other choices as well).

AUTHOR'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The menu is programmed to launch 'gnome-terminal' and 'gnome-screenshot -a' for the Terminal function and the screenshot function respectively. If you have a custom terminal/screenshot program, it will not be identified by this applet. Also, the website for this applet isn't established yet. I will be creating it within the next few days.
